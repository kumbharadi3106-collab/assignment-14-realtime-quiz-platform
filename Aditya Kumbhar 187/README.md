| `quiz:created` | `Server -> Host` | `{ "pin": "8421", "roomId": "quiz_8421" }` | Sends generated PIN to the host |
| `quiz:join` | `Player -> Server` | `{ "pin": "8421", "playerName": "Karan" }` | Player enters lobby with PIN |
| `lobby:update` | `Server -> Room` | `{ "players": [{ "name": "Karan", "score": 0 }] }` | Broadcasts lobby roster as players join |
| `quiz:start` | `Host -> Server` | `{ "pin": "8421" }` | Host starts the quiz battle |

### ⏱️ Question Round & Live Gameplay

## 🧮 4. Server-Side Scoring Algorithm

Score consists of a base score plus a response speed bonus:

$$\text{Total Score} = \text{Base Score (500)} + \left(\frac{\text{Time Remaining}}{\text{Total Time (15s)}} \times 500\right)$$

- Correct answer within 0s: **1000 points** (max)
- Correct answer with 5s remaining: **667 points**
- Incorrect answer: **0 points**

## 🧪 7. Testing & Verification

1. Start server and open `http://localhost:5001/host.html` on Tab 1. Note the 4-digit PIN generated on the Host screen.
2. Open Player View on Tab 2 and Tab 3 (`http://localhost:5001/player.html`). Enter the PIN and join as "Player 1" and "Player 2".
3. Verify both player names appear in real time on the Host screen roster.
4. Click **Start Game** on the Host screen.
5. Answer quickly on Player 1 and wait 10 seconds before answering on Player 2.
6. Verify Player 1 receives higher points due to the speed bonus.
7. Verify answers cannot be submitted after the 15-second clock expires.
